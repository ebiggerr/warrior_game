# WarriorX

Assignment from my first semester of Computer Science ( Problem Solving and Programming in Java ).
Thus, this 2D game named WarriorX is created.

## Overview

The `white box` have to avoid having collision with `red boxes` and the number of `red boxes` will increase 
as time goes.

Collision with `red boxes` will cause the `white box` to lose health, indicated with the health bar at the top left of the frame.

## Notes
This project obey semantic versioning. The latest version of WarriorX is v0.0.1 which is not a production-ready
version. 
This is because the development time is quite short and thus it not in active development anymore after the assignment assessment.
The game just quit when the health of `white box` become 0.

## Semantic Versioning

v0.0.1 Immature Release of WarriorX

### RoadMap

v1.0.0 Production-ready release fixing how the game handles the situation of health of 
`white box` become 0.

v2.0.0 Add Menu to the game and option to restart the game.
